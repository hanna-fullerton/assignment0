# My Response
What C++ review concepts would you like the professor to touch on again?

1. Pointer  
I get the concepts of pointer but struggle with using pointer.  
Some examples for actual use could be helpful.

2. Inheritance  
The sequence of inheritance is complex. So it is a little bit confusing for me.  
And also I want to make process of derived class clear.
